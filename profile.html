            <p>
                Sabb Singh, Mami Che, Belle, at kung sino ka pa man.  
                A woman who is a mother of all, a strong mom who believes that life is worth living even if there is a lot of people dragging her down–someone who continues to stand firm, inspire others, and lead with love and strength.  
                We wish you a joyful and Merry Christmas. Thank you for being our second mama, even though we have not met each other yet. Thank you for guiding us, loving us, and helping us in our daily lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may not know it, but everything that you do makes us feel appreciated and loved. Your presence, care, and support mean so much to us.  
                We hope this simple yet memorable gift brings you happiness and reminds you how truly valued you are.
